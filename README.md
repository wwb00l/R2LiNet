# R2LiNet
A demo of [R2LiNet](https://github.com/wwb00l/R2LiNet) <br />
This is a demo of a 4D millimeter wave enhancement network: R2LiNet, and the details of this algorithm will be released after the paper is received. If you have any questions, please contact the author(nj_wenbowang@163.com).<br />
The pre trained onnx can be [downloaded](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fxpOCZ6uKRmhc9BBAUB5A-7-CewrPJGG/view?usp=sharing) from Google Cloud Drive. <br />
The following image shows the results of using pre trained weights to predict samples "00000.hdf". <br />
